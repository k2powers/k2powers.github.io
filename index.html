<text>I'm not really in the mood to write a paragraph about myself to put on the web, so I'll just write about my cat Sally.
She is a one-eyed black cat with more attitude than seems possible to fit in her tiny cat body. She loves me, but really no one else.
She will attack and wrestle my other cat, who is twice her size and a big chicken.</text>
